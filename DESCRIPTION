Title: Learning Laplacian and adjacency matrices of graphs via spectral constraints.
Version: 0.1.0
Description: This package provides estimators of Laplacian and adjacency matrices
of Gaussian graphical models.  Those estimators take advantage of the
spectral properties from the graphical models as a prior information.  This allows
the learning of a variety of graphs such as k-component, bipartite, and k-component bipartite,
which play key roles in unsupervised machine learning tasks such as community detection
and clustering.
