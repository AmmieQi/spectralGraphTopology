# This module defines two operators, namely, L and Lstar,
# used in the graph learning problem.
# I'm trying to follow Google R's style guide:
# https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml


LOp <- function(w) {
  # The L operator, LOp, acts upon a vector w and returns
  # a matrix given by expression (5) in the Work Plan I.
  #
  # Args:
  #   w: vector which LOp will act upon.
  #
  # Returns:
  #   Lw: matrix

  return NA
}


LStarOp <- function(W) {
  # The L star operator, LStarOp, acts upon a matrix W and
  # returns a vector given by expression (7) in the Work Plan I.
  #
  # Args:
  #   W: matrix which LStarOp will act upon
  #
  # Returns:
  #   w: vector

  return NA
}
