# Problem Statement

Graphs are arguably one of the most popular mathematical structures
that find applications in a myriad of scientific and engineering fields.

In the era of big data, graphs can be used to model a vast diversity of
phenomenas, including customer preferences, brain activity, genetic structures,
just to name a few. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to be able to
reliably estimate such structures from noisy, often sparse and low-rank, datasets.

The Laplacian matrix $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ of a graph contains the information
about its topology, i.e., how nodes are connected among themselves. By definition
a Laplacian matrix is positive semi-definite, symmetric, and with sum of rows
equal to zero. The Laplacian linear operator $\mathcal{L}\mathbf{w}$ maps a
vector of edge weights $\mathbf{w}$ into a valid Laplacian matrix so that the conditions
listed above are satisfied by construction.

One common approach to estimate the Laplacian matrix of a graph would be via the generalized
inverse of the sample covariance matrix, which is an assymptotically unbiased and efficient
estimator. In this document, we call this approach the naive one. In R, this estimator can be
computed as simple as ``MASS::ginv(cov(Y))``, where``Y`` is the data matrix. However, this estimator
performs very poorly when the sample size is small when compared with the number of nodes, which
makes its use questionable for practical purposes.

Another classical approach, the well-known graph lasso algorithm, was proposed in
[@Friedman2008] where a $\ell_1$-norm penalty term was incorporated in order to induce
sparsity on the solution. The R package ``glasso`` provides an implementation of this estimator.

We, however, impose constraints on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix
in such a way that the underlying optimization problem may be expressed as follows:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\underset{\mathbf{w}, \boldsymbol{\Lambda}, \mathbf{U}}{\textsf{minimize}} & - \log \det(\boldsymbol{\Lambda})
+ \mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{S}\mathcal{L}\mathbf{w}\right) + \alpha h(\mathcal{L}\mathbf{w})
+ \frac{\beta}{2}\big\|\mathcal{L}\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{U}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{U}^{T}\big\|^{2}_{F}\\
\textsf{subject to} & \mathbf{w} \geq 0, \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \in \mathcal{S}_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}},~\text{and}~
\mathbf{U}^{T}\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}
\end{array}$$
where $h$ is a regularization function (e.g. to induce sparsity), $\mathbf{S}$ is the sample covariance matrix,
$\mathcal{S}_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}$ further constrains the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix.
For example, for a $k$-component graph with $p$ nodes,
$\mathcal{S}_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}} = \left\{{\lambda_i}_{i=1}^{p} | \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = ... = \lambda_k = 0,
0 < \lambda_{k+1} \leq \lambda_{k+2} \leq ... \leq \lambda_{p} \right\}$.

To solve this optimization problem, we employ a block majorization-minimization framework that updates each
of the variables ($\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{\Lambda}, \mathbf{U}$) at once while fixing the remaning ones.
For the mathematical details of the solution, including a convergence proof, please refer to our paper at: 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09792.pdf.

In order to learn bipartite graphs, we take advantage from the fact that the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix
of graph are symmetric around 0, and we formulate the following optimization problem:
$$
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{ll}
\underset{{\mathbf{w}},{\boldsymbol{\Psi}},{\mathbf{V}}}{\textsf{minimize}} &
\begin{array}{c}
- \log \det (\mathcal{L} \mathbf{w}+\frac{1}{p}\mathbf{11}^{T})+\text{tr}({\mathbf{S}\mathcal{L} \mathbf{w}})+
  \alpha h(\mathcal{L}\mathbf{w})+
  \frac{\nu}{2}\Vert \mathcal{A} \mathbf{w}-\mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Psi} \mathbf{V}^T \Vert_F^2,
\end{array}\\
\text{subject to} & \begin{array}[t]{l}
\mathbf{w} \geq 0, \ \boldsymbol{\Psi} \in \mathcal{S}_{\boldsymbol{\Psi}}, \ \text{and} \ \mathbf{V}^T\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{I},
\end{array}
\end{array}
\end{align}
$$

To estimate k-component bipartite graphs, we formulate the optimization problem by combining the constraints
related to the Laplacian and adjacency matrices.


# Package usage

The `spectralGraphTopology` package provides three main functions to estimate k-component, bipartite, and
k-component bipartite graphs, respectively: `learn_k_component_graph`, `learn_bipartite_graph`, and
`learn_bipartite_k_component`.  In the next subsections, we will check out how to apply those functions
in synthetic datasets.

## Learning a grid graph
```{r}
library(spectralGraphTopology)
library(igraph)
library(viridis)
set.seed(0)

p <- 64
grid <- make_lattice(length = sqrt(p), dim = 2)
n <- as.integer(100 * p)
E(grid)$weight <- runif(gsize(grid), min = 1e-1, max = 3)
Ltrue <- as.matrix(laplacian_matrix(grid))
Wtrue <- diag(diag(Ltrue)) - Ltrue
Y <- MASS::mvrnorm(n, mu = rep(0, p), Sigma = MASS::ginv(Ltrue))
S <- cov(Y)
graph <- learn_k_component_graph(S, w0 = "qp", beta = 20, alpha = 5e-3,
                                 abstol = 1e-5, verbose = FALSE)
graph$Adjacency[graph$Adjacency < 5e-2] <- 0
estimated_grid <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(graph$Adjacency,
                                              mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE)
colors <- viridis(20, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = -1)
c_scale <- colorRamp(colors)
E(estimated_grid)$color = apply(c_scale(E(estimated_grid)$weight / max(E(estimated_grid)$weight)), 1,
                          function(x) rgb(x[1]/255, x[2]/255, x[3]/255))
E(grid)$color = apply(c_scale(E(grid)$weight / max(E(grid)$weight)), 1,
                      function(x) rgb(x[1]/255, x[2]/255, x[3]/255))
V(estimated_grid)$color = "grey"
V(grid)$color = "grey"
la <- layout_on_grid(grid)
plot(grid, layout = la, vertex.label = NA, vertex.size = 3)
title("True grid graph")
plot(estimated_grid, layout = la, vertex.label = NA, vertex.size = 3)
title("Estimated grid graph")
```

## Learning a 3-component graph

The next snippet of code shows how to learn the clusters of a set of points
distributed on the plane.

```{r}
library(spectralGraphTopology)
library(clusterSim)
library(igraph)

set.seed(42)
# number of nodes per cluster
n <- 100
# generate datapoints
circles3 <- shapes.circles3(n)
# number of components
k <- 3
# compute sample correlation matrix
S <- crossprod(t(circles3$data))
# estimate underlying graph
graph <- learn_k_component_graph(S, k = k, beta = 1, verbose = FALSE, fix_beta = FALSE, abstol = 1e-3)
# build network
net <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(graph$Adjacency, mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE)
# colorify nodes and edges
colors <- c("#706FD3", "#FF5252", "#33D9B2")
V(net)$cluster <- circles3$clusters
E(net)$color <- apply(as.data.frame(get.edgelist(net)), 1,
                      function(x) ifelse(V(net)$cluster[x[1]] == V(net)$cluster[x[2]],
                                        colors[V(net)$cluster[x[1]]], '#000000'))
V(net)$color <- colors[circles3$clusters]
plot(net, layout = circles3$data, vertex.label = NA, vertex.size = 3)

```

Similar structures may be inferred as well. The plots below depict the results of applying
`learn_k_component_graph` on a variaety of spatially distributed points.

# Performance comparison

We use the following baseline algorithms for performance comparison:

1. the generalized inverse of the sample covariance matrix, denoted as Naive;
2. a quadratic program estimator given by $\textsf{minimize}\Vert\mathbf{S}^{\dagger} - \mathcal{L}\mathbf{w}\Vert_{F}$, where $\mathbf{S}^{\dagger}$ is the generalized inverse of the sample covariance matrix, denoted as QP;
3. the Combinatorial Graph Laplacian proposed by [@Egilmez2017] denoted as CGL.

The plots below show the performance in terms of F-score and relative error among the proposed algorithm, denoted as SGL,
and the baseline ones when learning a grid graph with 64 nodes and edges uniformly drawn from [.1, 3].  For each algorithm,
the shaded area and the solid curve represent the standard deviation and the mean of several Monte Carlo realizations.
It can be noticed that SGL outperforms all the baseline algorithms in all sample size regimes.  Such superior
performance maybe be attributed to the highly structured nature of grid graphs.

In a similar fashion, the plots below shows algorithmic performance for modular graphs with 64 nodes and 4 modules,
such that the probability of connection within module was set to 50%, whereas the probability of connection accross
modules was set to 1%. In this scenario, SGL outperforms the baselines algorithms QP and Naive, while having a similar
performance to that of CGL.  This may be explained by the fact that the edges connecting nodes do not quite have a
deterministic structure like those of the grid graphs.

# Clustering

One of the most direct applications of learning k-component graphs is on the
classical unsupervised machine learning problem: data clustering.

We make use of two datasets here: the animals dataset published by and the cancer-RNA dataset available at
